# My Library
A digital library for tracking books. Users can add or remove books, including title, author, page count, and read status. This was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Motivation
This project was made to:
- Experiment with vintage design styles.
- Learn how to effectively handle user-generated content and present it in a specific format.
- Understand how to address user modifications in existing data. 

## Quick Start

To add a new book, users click the "Add book" button and then fill out the form to provide the book's title, author, page count, and read status.
